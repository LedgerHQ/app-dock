# How to use Ledger Nano with Dock

## Introduction

The app is used to manage Dock's native tokens. The app can be used to transfer tokens, stake tokens as a validator or 
nominator and participate in governance by voting. The explorer is available [here](https://fe-staging.dock.io/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fknox-1.dock.io#/explorer). We recommend using Ledger vs paper or browser wallet to individuals with a substantial amount of tokens. For any queries, send us an email at support.dock.io.
